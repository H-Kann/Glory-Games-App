# Glory Games App
Glory Games is a desktop application developed with C#. 
The client asked for a simple program to manage the entries, and each entry is editable in a grid view. 

The grid view exports the entries entered as an excel spreadsheet dated by the day and the time it was exported.
There is also a timer (which can be paused, stopped, and resumed) for each of the consoles, and each timer is numbered to each post.
